          <p>I have taken following courses in Northeastern University:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Object-Oriented Design</h3>
              <p>
                Presents a comparative approach to object-oriented programming
                and design. Discusses the concepts of object, class, metaclass,
                message, method, inheritance, and genericity. Reviews forms of
                polymorphism in object-oriented languages. Contrasts the use of
                inheritance and composition as dual techniques for software
                reuse—forwarding vs. delegation and subclassing vs. subtyping.
                Offers students an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding
                of the principles of object-oriented programming and design,
                including software components, object-oriented design patterns,
                and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified
                modeling language). Illustrates basic concepts in
                object-oriented design with case studies in application
                frameworks and by writing programs in Java.

              <h3>
                Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Applications within
                Computer Systems
              </h3>
              <p>
                Presents an integrated approach to the study of data structures,
                algorithms, and their application within systems topics.
                Introduces a variety of fundamental algorithmic techniques
                (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms) and
                systems topics (models of computation, computer architecture,
                compilation, system software, networking). Demonstrates the
                integration of topics through programming assignments in the C
                language that implement fundamental data structures (lists,
                queues, trees, maps, graphs) and algorithms as they are applied
                in computer systems. Additional breadth topics include
                programming applications that expose students to primitives of
                different subsystems using threads and sockets.
              </p>

            <li>
              <h3>Web Development</h3>
              <p>
                Discusses Web development for sites that are dynamic, data
                driven, and interactive. Focuses on the software development
                issues of integrating multiple languages, assorted data
                technologies, and Web interaction. Considers ASP.NET, C#, HTTP,
                HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT, JavaScript, AJAX, RSS/Atom, SQL, and Web
                services. Each student must deploy individually designed Web
                experiments that illustrate the Web technologies and at least
                one major integrative Web site project. Students may work in
                teams with the permission of the instructor. Each student or
                team must also create extensive documentation of their goals,
                plans, design decisions, accomplishments, and user guidelines.
                All source files must be open and be automatically served by a
                sources server.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Foundations of Software Engineering</h3>
              <p>
                Covers the foundations of software engineering, including
                software development life cycle models (e.g., waterfall, spiral,
                agile); requirements analysis; user-centered design; software
                design principles and patterns; testing (functional testing,
                structural testing, testing strategies); code refactoring and
                debugging; software architecture and design; and integration and
                deployment. Includes a course project where some of the software
                engineering methods (from requirements analysis to testing) are
                applied in a team-based setting. Requires admission to MS
                program or completion of all transition courses.
